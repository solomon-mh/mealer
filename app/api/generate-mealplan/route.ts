      You are a professional nutritionist. Create a 7-day meal plan for an individual following a ${dietType} diet aiming for ${calories} calories per day.
      
      Allergies or restrictions: ${allergies || "none"}.
      Preferred cuisine: ${cuisine || "no preference"}.
      Snacks included: ${snacks ? "yes" : "no"}.
      
      For each day, provide:
        - Breakfast
        - Lunch
        - Dinner
        ${snacks ? "- Snacks" : ""}
      
      Use simple ingredients and provide brief instructions. Include approximate calorie counts for each meal.
      
      Structure the response as a JSON object where each day is a key, and each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) is a sub-key. Example:
      
      {
        "Monday": {
          "Breakfast": "Oatmeal with fruits - 350 calories",
          "Lunch": "Grilled chicken salad - 500 calories",
          "Dinner": "Steamed vegetables with quinoa - 600 calories",
          "Snacks": "Greek yogurt - 150 calories"
        },
        "Tuesday": {
          "Breakfast": "Smoothie bowl - 300 calories",
          "Lunch": "Turkey sandwich - 450 calories",
          "Dinner": "Baked salmon with asparagus - 700 calories",
          "Snacks": "Almonds - 200 calories"
        }
        // ...and so on for each day
      }

      Return just the json with no extra commentaries and no backticks.
